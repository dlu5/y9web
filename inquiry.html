<h1>Explanation & Justification</h1>
    
    <p>Currently the WHO data is displayed in a table that is cluttered and not user-friendly. In order to further educate the public about the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit for different countries. Readily available and user friendly data will help reduce drinking and driving related accidents and infringements and further promote safety and responsibility. Among young/novice drivers the legal BAC limit may be hard to find in different countries. Drinking and driving is an issue in society that will not cease to exist until people are educated. Legal BAC limits are often a good reference point for driving sober. Rather than face uncertainty caused by anecdotes or Google searches of inaccurate sources, my site will provided an accurate and user friendly reference for these users. The majority of young/novice drivers do not sort through the WHO website and its cluttered subtopics and sections to scroll through tabular data to find info. My site will provide readily available and aesthetically pleasing data which will prevent law violations and encourage sober driving. HTML5 canvas is a powerful way to graphically display such info.</p>

<h1>Research and Skills</h1>
    
    <p>I will need to learn more about HTML5 canvas text options as well as colour themes and backgrounds to make my site more aesthestically pleasing. In additon, I will need to research graphing on HTML5 canvas and using different graphs (pie graph, bar graph) that I can use to display tabular data. I would like to be able to use JS to create interactive buttons and animations/illustrations. I would like to learn how to index the tabular data (.json file) into a searchable/filterable format. In addition, I need to learn how to format the .json data into dropdowns and autocompletes.</p>
