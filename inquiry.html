<h1>Explanation & Justification</h1>
    
    <p>Currently the WHO data is displayed in a table that is cluttered and not user-friendly. In order to further educate the public about the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit for different countries. Readily available and user friendly data will help reduce drinking and driving related accidents and infringements and further promote safety and responsibility. Among young/novice drivers the legal BAC limit may be hard to find in different countries. Drinking and driving is an issue in society that will not cease to exist until people are educated. Legal BAC limits are often a good reference point for driving sober. Rather than face uncertainty caused by anecdotes or Google searches of inaccurate sources, my site will provided an accurate and user friendly reference for these users. The majority of young/novice drivers do not sort through the WHO website and its cluttered subtopics and sections to scroll through tabular data to find info. My site will provide readily available and aethetically pleasing data which will prevent law violations and encourage sober driving. HTML5 canvas is a powerful way to graphically display such info.</p>

    
<h1>Research and Skills</h1>
    
    <p>I will need to learn more about HTML5 canvas text options as well as colour themes and backgrounds to make my site more aethestically pleasing. In additon, I will need to research graphing on HTML5 canvas and using different graphs (pie graph, bar graph) that I can use to display tabular data. I would like to be able to use JS to create interactive buttons and animations/illustrations. I would like to learn how to index the tabular data into a searchable/filterable format. In addition, I need to learn how to format the .json data into dropdowns and autocompletes.</p>
    

<h1>Primary Research Plan</h1>
<p>   
    1. Research HTML5 canvas graph drawings <br>
    2. Learn to create bar graph <br>
    3. Learn to customize font/text <br>
    4. Alphabetical filter option <br>
    5. Further learn more CSS button customizations (ex. sizes, colours, font) <br>
    6. Learn to create a "enter" button to search using entered fields 
 </p>    
    
 
<h1>Secondary Research Plan</h1>  
    1. Learn to create HTML5 canvas animations <br>
    2. Dropdown with list of countries <br>  
    3. Learn to create an autocomplete typing entry widget (population.io) <br>

<h1>Design Brief</h1>
    <p>   
    1. Will have an autocomplete to save the user time when typing in the country name <br>
    2. Will have a slider on a number line labeled with the range of legal BAC limits to let the user explore the stats for difference countries <br>
    3. Will have a link to WHO stats for users to view tabular data <br>
    4. Will have a bar graph of all listed countries and their legal BAC limits to give a quick visual representation <br>
    5. Will have 
    

        
        
    This site will provide tourists and travelers, who may be young/novice drivers, an easy and convenient reference point for the legal BAC limits in different countries to help discourage drinking and driving and to help reduce driving accidents and infringements.
