<h1>Explanation & Justification</h1>
    
    <p>Currently the WHO data is displayed in a table that is cluttered and not user-friendly. In order to further educate the public about the legal blood alcohol content for different countries. Readily available and user friendly data will help reduce infringements and further promote safety and responsibility. HTML5 canvas is a powerful way to graphically display such info.</p>

<h1>Primary Research and Skills</h1>
    
    <p>I will need to learn more about HTML5 canvas text options as well as colour themes and backgrounds to make my site more aethestically pleasing. In additon, I will need to research graphing on HTML5 canvas and using different graphs (pie graph, bar graph) that I can use to display tabular data. Furthermore, I must be able to customize these graphs easily. I would like to be able to use JS to create interactive buttons and illustrations. I would like to learn how to index the tabular data into a searchable format. In addition I need to be able to use CSS to create rounded buttons and aethetically pleasing formats.</p>
