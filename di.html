<p>
In my research of websites displaying WHO Sustainable Development Goal 3 data, most of the websites were very well designed with graphs and button to control the data displayed on the site. However, the websites all had a few cons that can be improved upon by my product. Some websites have side corner pockets with distracting social media links and clunky scrolling, while others have too much data leading to a cluttered site or not enough ways to search through the data. <br>
    
My product will solve these issues by have smoother scrolling by ensure that the site does not have redundant code that makes loading slower as well as not having too much data to overwhelm the user. In addition, the site will have an easy way to search for countries through a search bar that has auto-complete. Finally no social media link for promotions will be displayed on my site. <br>
    
Finally, my site will build off the well designed functions and features of the 5 researched sites and will use aspects described in my Design Brief. My site will include animations to create a more visually entertaining experience. </p><br>

<h3>S# refers to the specification that has been followed</h3>
<br>   
<p>I chose Design 1 because it is more aesthetically pleasing due to the uncluttered and simple page layout, with a useful navigation bar and user-friendly favicon (S5, S6, S10). It does not overwhelm the user with information or graphs and it is easy to navigate with lots of pleasant animations and aesthetically pleasing buttons (S7, S8, S9). This design is also better suited for my target audience are novice drivers and tourists who do not want to scroll through long graphs with lots of empirical data. The scrolling is further improved by the addition of scrolling buttons (S15). The easy to enter Country selection box has auto-complete and a list generated by auto-complete (S12, S13). My product aims to provide a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to access info. However, if the user wishes to the original WHO tabular data is available via a button link in the top right (S3). Finally, all the info on the selected country is summarized by a concise sentence at the bottom (S14).</p>
